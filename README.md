Notes from the Codeschool Objective-C Primer
==================

This is some simple code written while reading <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rubymaverick/objective-c-primer-ft-mr-higgie">An Objective-C Primer</a> by Eric Allam (with help from Mr. Higgie).

For Students
==================

When reading a programming book, I strongly recommend having two things open in addition to the book / ebook: your editor or ide, and some mechanism for taking notes.

* Read the text
* Manually type in the code (no copy/paste!)
* Build and run each example as you progress through topics
* Commit your work, and move on
* Take notes about features, technologies, concepts, topics, things to explore deeper later. <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s63/sh/fb8e4014-d9b6-43f5-8013-681ff50e5e46/4dcfa8acbd06c6b1ded13b23bfc45eb1">Here is an example</a>.

Be sure to write meaningful commit messages. Use git tags or little mnemonics in your commit messages that correspond to pages, sections or chapters of the text.
